1)working on paper"A Novel Neural Network Model based on Cerebral Hemispheric Asymmetry for EEG Emotion Recognition"
2) main paper about datasets "Investigating Critical Frequency Bands and Channels for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition with Deep Neural Networks"
3) exracted preprocessed eeg datasets to python 
4) understanding datasets and working on data processing since this work is based on left and right hemispheric eeg data separtely
